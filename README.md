The Probability Distribution Function (PDF) model predicts the solar wind speed 5 days in advance.
No step is required to install other than downloading the project.
IDL is required to run the PDF model.

To run PDF: ./pdf.sh YYYYMMDDHH1111
where YYYY, MM, DD, and HH represent the year, month, day, and hour of the start of the predictions.
For example: ./pdf.sh 20170808021111
will run PDF to predict the solar wind speed from August 8 to August 13, 2017.
The 1111 charcters are options that you can change with regard to the formats of the output.
